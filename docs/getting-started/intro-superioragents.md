Welcome to Superior Agents 101! This page is your introduction to our framework that lets AI systems to continuously improve through evolution and real-world feedback. Unlike traditional agents that operate on fixed instructions, Superior Agents are designed to adapt, learn, and evolveâ€”becoming increasingly capable over time.

## 1. Understanding Superior Agents

Superior Agents are a new paradigm in AI. They combine self-improving code generation, robust testing modules, and continuous retraining loops to create systems that evolve autonomously. This approach enables the agent to:

- Learn from past experiences to tackle new problems.
- Adjust strategies based on real-world performance.
- Continuously refine its capabilities for a future of truly intelligent, adaptive systems.

## 2. Get Started with Installation & Setup

Begin by checking out our [Installation & Setup section](/docs/category/installation) where you'll find all the necessary steps to set up and configure agent:

- Learn how to install dependencies and configure your environment.
- Follow detailed guides to get your system up and running.
- Find troubleshooting tips and best practices for a smooth setup.

## 3. Engage with the Superior Agents Community
