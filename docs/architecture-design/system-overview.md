# System Overview

This document provides an overview of the system architecture, including a visual diagram and a detailed explanation of how components interact. Use this page to guide developers in understanding and extending the system.

## Visual Diagram and Component Interaction

Developers are encouraged to include a visual diagram that illustrates the system's architecture and the interactions between its components. To add your own diagram and explanation, follow these steps:

1. **Create or Update the Diagram:**  
   - Create a diagram using your preferred tool (e.g., draw.io, Lucidchart, or any other diagramming software).
   - Export the diagram as an image file (PNG, JPG, or SVG).
   - Save the image in the `/img` folder of your Docusaurus project (for example, as `/img/system-diagram.png`).

2. **Embed the Diagram in this Page:**  
   - Use Markdown image syntax to embed the diagram:
     
     ```md
     ![System Diagram](/img/system-diagram.png)
     ```
     
   - Place this image wherever it fits best within your explanation.

3. **Add an Explanation:**  
   - Provide a detailed explanation of the diagram. Describe how each component interacts, what their responsibilities are, and any key integration points.
   - You can format your explanation using Markdown headers, lists, and code blocks if needed.

4. **Keep It Updated:**  
   - As the system evolves, ensure that the diagram and explanation remain current. Regularly update the content as new components are added or existing ones are modified.
