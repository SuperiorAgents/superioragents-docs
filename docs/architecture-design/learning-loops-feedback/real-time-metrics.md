# Real-Time Metrics

This page provides guidance on integrating real-time evolution via success metrics (e.g., likes, wallet value, and other key performance indicators) into the Superior Agents framework. The aim is to help developers design systems that dynamically adjust and evolve based on real-world performance data.

## Instructions for Developers

To add real-time metrics functionality, consider the following steps:

1. **Identify Relevant Metrics:**  
   Determine which metrics best reflect the agent's performance. Examples include:
   - **Social Media:** Likes, follows, engagement rate.
   - **Financial:** Wallet value, profit/loss, trading volume.
   - **User Interaction:** Response time, conversion rates.

2. **Implement Data Collection:**  
   - Data feeds to gather the chosen metrics in real time.
   - Ensure that data collection is robust and secure.
   - Store the collected data for historical analysis and trend tracking.

3. **Process and Analyze the Data:**  
   - Normalize and clean the data for consistency.
   - Visualize the data using dashboards or logging systems to monitor agent performance.

4. **Integrate Metrics into the Learning Loop:**  
   - Use the real-time metrics as part of the agentâ€™s reward function.
   - Reward strategies that improve metrics (e.g., increased likes or higher wallet value) and penalize those that do not.
   - Consider triggering retraining cycles or strategy adjustments based on the observed performance data.
