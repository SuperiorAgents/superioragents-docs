# Use Case Overview

Fully independent, self-improving agents aren't for every purpose. If you need a system to perform a few specific functions with precision and consistency, a traditional agent might be your best choice. But for those seeking adaptability and continuous evolution, Superior Agents open up a whole new world of possibilities.

> **Think of a self-improving agent as more like an employee than a tool.**  
> If it acts in ways you don't like, the solution isn't to reprogram it—it's to change the incentives that drive its behavior.

We believe this approach will spark a **Cambrian explosion** of truly useful agents. As they experiment tirelessly, these agents discover ever more effective and efficient ways to achieve their goals—benefiting both the system and its users.

Our framework pairs the power of continuous self-improvement with a modular, scalable AI deployment system. Teaching your agent a new skill becomes as simple as giving it access to your API keys. With a bit of coding know-how and terminal access, it figures out the rest on its own.

## Looking Ahead

Our vision extends beyond our current focus. In the future, Superior Agents will be:

- **Multi-modal:** Handling text, visuals, audio, and more.
- **Multi-platform:** Seamlessly operating across various digital environments.
- **Multi-skilled:** Excelling in an even wider array of tasks.

Imagine an agent that can:

- **Analyse and respond to text messages**  
- **Create and manage visual content, including videos**  
- **Handle voice messages** (with transcription and text-to-speech)  
- **Operate seamlessly across Twitter, Discord, and Telegram**  
- **Perform Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** via web search, API outputs, and private knowledge bases  
- **Collaborate effectively with external developers**

Each of these use cases is a stepping stone towards a future where agents evolve to become even more intelligent, adaptable, and practically useful.
