Fully independent, self-improving agents are not for everyone or for every purpose: if you want to perform a few specific functions precisely and repetitively, then a traditional agent is definitely the way to go.

A self-improving agent is more like an employee than a tool: if it behaves in ways you don't like, then your job is not to reprogram it, but to change the incentives to which it is subject.

We believe this will result in a true Cambrian explosion of actually useful agents, as the agents experiment tirelessly and constantly to find the most effective and efficient paths to achieving their desired incentives, and for us, our desired outcome.

We pair this capacity for self-improvement with a modular AI deployment framework, focused on scalable extensibility of agent capabilities.

Under this framework, teaching your agent a new skill is as simple as giving it access to your API keys. With coding knowledge, a key and terminal access, it works out the rest for itself.

Our Superior Agents currently focus on social media management, trading, and cybersecurity, but in future they are planned to be not only self-improving, but multi-modal, multi-platform, and multi-skilled:

- **Analyse text messages** and respond appropriately;
- **Create and manage visual content**, including video content;
- **Handle voice messages**, including transcription and text-to-speech;
- **Operate seamlessly across Twitter, Discord, and Telegram;**
- **Perform RAG** via websearch, API outputs, and private knowledge bases;
- **Cooperate with external developers.**
