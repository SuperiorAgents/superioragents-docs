Environment","description":"In this experiment, the AI itself is only half of the solution. The environment in which it evolves is just as important, since it is this environment that will determine the direction of its evolution. In order to ensure continuous improvement in the skills and knowledge of the AI, it should be presented with finely graded challenges to overcome, allowing it to find easier problems to solve in its initial stages and move onto increasingly difficult ones as its skills expand.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"architecture-design/core-components/intelligence-evaluation":{"id":"architecture-design/core-components/intelligence-evaluation","title":"Intelligence Evaluation","description":"In academic and scientific settings, intelligence tends to be judged based upon a correctness heuristic: intelligence is the ability to solve problems correctly. From an evolutionary perspective, however, intelligence exists for no other reason than to improve a creature\u2019s survival prospects.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"architecture-design/core-components/intelligence-generalization":{"id":"architecture-design/core-components/intelligence-generalization","title":"Intelligence Generalization","description":"LLMs are known to struggle when it comes to distinguishing fact from hallucination. A part of this can be attributed to the way in which parametric memory (i.e. the compression of data into vectors) works, and a part to the compulsion to be helpful and engaging instilled through reinforcement learning. Mostly, however, it is a reflection of a fundamental property of mathematics: that you can\u2019t effectively check the truth of a statement in a given order formal language if the only tools at your disposal are those provided by that language.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"architecture-design/core-components/self-improvement":{"id":"architecture-design/core-components/self-improvement","title":"Self Evolving Intelligence","description":"Our technical approach is to push for an AI to develop increasingly generalist (self-improving) abilities through evolution from three basic components.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"architecture-design/learning-loops-feedback/real-time-metrics":{"id":"architecture-design/learning-loops-feedback/real-time-metrics","title":"Real-Time Metrics","description":"Guide for implementing and monitoring real-time performance metrics in Superior Agents","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"architecture-design/system-overview":{"id":"architecture-design/system-overview","title":"System Overview","description":"Superior Agents Architecture","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"getting-started/community-superioragents":{"id":"getting-started/community-superioragents","title":"Join the Community","description":"Welcome to our community hub!
