You can read the original paper [here](https://xianyangcb.substack.com/p/a-system-for-evolving-general-artificial-intelligence-from-existing-technologies-b4f5c4d1335a).\\n\\n### ![IPOS ](./1.jpg)\\n\\nNow, labs like [Google DeepMind](https://x.com/GoogleDeepMind/status/1910363683215008227) are heading in the same direction. The race is on.\\n\\n## What We\'ve Built So Far\\n\\n**Core Framework Implemented**: We\'ve open-sourced our [original architecture](https://github.com/Lexikat-Pte-Ltd/Generalisation2): an AI that autonomously strives to expand its reach and retrains based on success metrics. [Theory paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04711) is published, results incoming.\\n\\n**Commercial Applications**: We\'ve also released simplified agents for crypto trading and social media management. Available to download [here](https://github.com/SuperiorAgents/superior-agents), or try the [GUI](https://superioragents.com/) here.\\n\\nBecause while [playing Minecraft](https://minedojo.org/) or [manage vending machines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15840) are laudable achievements for a young AI, if you really want to toughen one up you give it $500 and send it out to trade high-leverage perps.\\n\\n### ![SA screenshot ](./2.png)\\n[Superioragents.com/live-agents](https://superioragents.com/live-agents)\\n\\n## Next Steps\\n\\nNow we are are going to go deeper.\\n\\n*   **Collect high-entropy RL data** from real-world deployments (e.g. [Superior Agents](https://superioragents.com/live-agents));\\n*   **Train models to generalise** using self-generated data via text diffusion (e.g., [DiffuLLaMA](https://github.com/HKUNLP/DiffuLLaMA), [Dream 7B](https://hkunlp.github.io/blog/2025/dream/));\\n*   **Enable continuous retraining** with [no-prop diffusion models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.24322).\\n\\nWe believe this is the fastest\u2014and only viable\u2014route to ASI. Now we will explain why.\\n\\n### Sourcing High-Quality Reinforcement Learning Data\\n\\nReinforcement learning systems today are shackled by benchmarks and human-generated data:\\n\\n*   They can\'t surpass human-level IQ if they\'re trained only on human-generated examples.\\n*   When they do, their answers will be marked \\"wrong\\" according to the [benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.04127) and corrected.\\n\\nThe early fix was to scale synthetic data\u2014but this usually leads to low-entropy outputs and model collapse.\\n\\n### ![Model Collapse ](./3.jpg)\\n\\n*Image credit: [Nature/Emily Wenger](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02355-z)*\\n\\nWhy? Because the goal is still to imitate humans, so models converge on the average case rather than exploring the tails. You can try to fix this by [human-curating the synthetic data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14689) (Anthropic seems to do a lot of this).\\n\\nWe\'re betting on a different approach. The \\"all golden retrievers\\" effect depicted above is a result of giving the model the goal of imitating human-produced data. It imitates the examples it sees most frequently rather than taking the riskier approach of trying to copy a elements from the tails. Thus the distribution of the generated data is much narrower than the original set, limiting not just the scope of the resulting model but also its [compositional generalisation abilities](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01774).\\n\\nData generated during independent real-world interaction should have higher entropy. That means more tail cases, richer abstractions, and less collapse. Instead of \\"act human,\\" the objective becomes: succeed in the world.\\n\\n## Generalisation Based on Self-Generated Data\\n\\nThe lack of fresh data to train much bigger models on has contributed to a \\"[scaling plateau](https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/openai-rivals-seek-new-path-smarter-ai-current-methods-hit-limitations-2024-11-11/)\\" \u2013 models can no longer get better by simply getting bigger. Instead, the large AI companies have been focusing on other strategies.\\n\\n*   OpenAI chose to concentrate on [test-time compute scaling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03314) or similar interventions \u2013 basically giving the model more time to think about the answer or to calculate the relative likelihood of multiple answers.\\n*   Deepseek focused on [training its models on reasoning in particular](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12948), pushing them to adopt modes of speech that mimic the way humans speak when they\'re reasoning.\\n\\nWe aim to implement the same reinforcement learning approach as Deepseek: [Group Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03300). This is a form of fine-tuning that involves giving the model not just single question-and-answer pairs to memorise, but rather one question and multiple answers, ranked from best to worse. This helps the model build up an abstract idea of the thing you\'re trying to teach it rather than just a memorising a stack of related analogies.\\n\\nWe are going to take this further, however. We know that grokking models - systematically over-training them \u2013 can supercharge their abstract thinking abilities. This seems to happen when the models find a low-rank solution to encode not only the questions and answers in the training set, but the [relationships between the various categories](https://xianyangcb.substack.com/p/defining-t-schemas-via-the-parametric) of training data within the set.\\n\\nGrokking transformers is expensive with uncertain rewards, but [diffusion models seem to grok natively](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/file/9d0f188c7947eacb0c07f709576824f6-Paper-Conference.pdf) straight from the get-go. Until recently there were no large text diffusion models available for experimentation, but over the past months two open source models and one closed source one have been/are being released:\\n\\n*   [Diffullama](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.17891)\\n*   [Dream 7b](https://github.com/HKUNLP/Dream)\\n*   [Mercury](https://www.inceptionlabs.ai/)\\n\\nThis provides the perfect opportunity to use our high-quality model-generated data to GRPO fine-tune a Dream 7b model, demonstrating that **models can generalise from data they themselves created**.\\n\\n## No-Prop Diffusion for Continuous Retraining\\n\\nThe final barrier to ASI lies in the difficulty inherent in continuously retraining an AI model \u2013 the \\"warm start\\" problem. Retraining a model that has already been trained tends to have diminishing returns, and can also lead to more extreme problems like [catastrophic forgetting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.04484). If models cannot retrain themselves on new information they encounter, they are incapable to self-improvement.\\n\\nRegular back-propagation models are hard to retrain because the links between parts of the model architecture are so complex. Improving one part of the model may destroy the coherence of another. [No-propagation models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.24322) allow for the retraining of small batches of neurons without affecting the rest of the model, having the potential to make incremental retraining not just possible but cost effective. If we can achieve no-propagation retraining of a text diffusion model on data the model itself has generated, our model will be able to adapt continuously to changing environments and - more importantly - continue to improve indefinitely.\\n\\n## The Call to Action\\n\\nWe are currently raising funds and hiring people with MLops and AI engineering skills.\\n\\nIf you have access to the former or the latter, please message us: jen@eigenform.ai."},{"id":"2025-04-23-superior-agents","metadata":{"permalink":"/superioragents-docs/blog/2025-04-23-superior-agents","editUrl":"https://github.com/superioragents/superior-agents/edit/main/blog/blog/2025-04-23-superior-agents/2025-04-23-superior-agents.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-04-23-superior-agents/2025-04-23-superior-agents.md","title":"Superior Agents Reimagining AI with Darwinian Self-Improvement","description":"Why imitation will never yield true AGI\u2014and how Superior Agents chart a radical new path.","date":"2025-04-23T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Superior Agents","permalink":"/superioragents-docs/blog/tags/superioragents","description":"Superior Agents tag description"}],"readingTime":2.485,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Emir A.","title":"DevRel Lead @ KIP","page":{"permalink":"/superioragents-docs/blog/authors/emir"},"socials":{"x":"https://x.com/selcukemiravci","github":"https://github.com/selcukemiravci"},"imageURL":"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1893224272166035458/P7_7kmgt_400x400.jpg","key":"emir"},{"name":"Jen D.","title":"Chief AI Engineer @ KIP","page":{"permalink":"/superioragents-docs/blog/authors/jen"},"socials":{"x":"https://x.com/HumanLevelJen"},"imageURL":"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1901655765217386496/zDy92W3H_400x400.jpg","key":"jen"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2025-04-23-superior-agents","title":"Superior Agents Reimagining AI with Darwinian Self-Improvement","authors":["emir","jen"],"tags":["Superior Agents"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"What\'s Next: No supervision.

These models master the art of mimicry\u2014reproducing patterns we\'ve labeled and approved\u2014but they cannot transcend those patterns. If an AI were to discover a strategy that outperforms human reasoning, our evaluation frameworks would likely flag it as \\"incorrect,\\" simply because it deviates from the training labels. The result is a self-limiting loop: intelligence capped at the level of its creators.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nWhat if we abandoned imitation altogether and embraced evolution? Superior Agents propose exactly that shift. Instead of feeding models \\"right answers,\\" we give them real-world objectives and let them learn through experimentation, adaptation, and survival. This isn\'t conventional training or fine-tuning\u2014it\'s **Darwinian learning**.\\n\\nFor evolution to drive genuine progress, feedback must be objective and ungameable. Human-scored benchmarks are vulnerable to overfitting and manipulation. Superior Agents, by contrast, measure success via **numeric, external metrics** that reflect true outcomes: disk space claimed, profit in a trading account, or genuine growth in social engagement.

This Darwinian filter fosters robustness and continual growth.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### Hypothesis Generation with Diffusion Models\\n\\nA key innovation is leveraging **diffusion models** to generate hypotheses.

For AI models this is extremely difficult. LLMs are known to struggle when it comes to distinguishing fact and hallucination. A part of this can be attributed to the way in which parametric memory (i.e. the compression of data into vectors) works, and a part to the compulsion to be helpful and engaging instilled through reinforcement learning. Mostly, however it is a reflection of a fundamental property of mathematics: that you can\'t effectively check the truth of a statement in a given order formal language if the only tools at your disposal are those provided by that language. Or, alternatively:\\n\\n### ![Undefinability Theorem ](./1.jpg)\\n\\n> In other words, there is no way to prove that 1+1=2 using basic arithmetic alone[^1].\\n\\nOperating as it does at a single layer of abstraction, an AI model is incapable of saying that 1+1=328 is definitely wrong; it can only say that it is improbable. To deal with this issue, the principal solution has been to increase the size of models and the amount of training data used, as well as employing standardized benchmarks (model IQ tests) to assess performance.\\n\\nThe problem with this approach is that if both the training materials and the test are human-produced, the AI is unlikely to ever get much more intelligent than the most intelligent human in any given field[^2]. Until we build an AI that can discover and integrate its own knowledge, artificial super-intelligence will remain out of reach.\\n\\nBut if the only way to learn new things is from smarter humans, then how did the smartest human do it?\\n\\n## The Work-Arounds\\n\\nFortunately, there are two ways around this problem. The first is **reality testing**. I couldn\'t employ first-order arithmetic to prove that 1+1=2, but I just have to hold up two fingers to know it to be true. Not having contact with the physical world, it is harder for LLMs to do this, but not impossible\u2014give an AI an enumerable, extensible, and objective metric that is outside its control (such as the amount of storage space taken up by its own backups or the amount of money in a crypto wallet) and the coding tools to interact with the world in such a way as to affect this metric, and it will begin reality-testing hypotheses immediately. If the status of successful and failed attempts is then stored for future fine-tuning, the model becomes capable of self-improvement (as we have demonstrated [elsewhere](https://xianyangcb.substack.com/p/a-system-for-evolving-general-artificial-intelligence-from-existing-technologies-b4f5c4d1335a)).\\n\\nUnder this approach, no smarter human is required: the model comes up with its own ideas, tests them, and learns which work and which don\'t from its own testing. After all, when Newton developed his theory of gravitation, he checked it against observed planetary movements, not against the opinions of someone more intelligent.\\n\\nBut he did something else as well, which brings us to the **second work-around**: he created a higher-order metalanguage for the purpose of establishing a [T-schema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-schema)\u2014that is, an inductive abstraction of truth against which lower-order propositions may be tested. Based on empirical data concerning planetary movements (or at least Kepler\'s data), he derived a set of formulae that succinctly explained all of these movements. From that point on, if the formula says that Mercury should be 36 million miles from the sun, while your latest observation suggests that it is only 24 miles away, then the likelihood is that your observation is wrong\u2014after all, the formula can cite every single previous observation to back it up.\\n\\n## Truth Through Consensus\\n\\nIn this article we suggest that recent evidence from several papers suggests that this is what AI models are attempting to do via the **grokking** process.\\n\\n\\n**Grokking** refers to a phenomenon where AI models\' test responses improve with more training, grow worse as they pass the point of over-training (i.e., when they become too focused on memorizing the training set and lose the ability to generalize), and then suddenly improve to an astonishing degree.\\n\\n### ![Modular Divison](./2.png)\\n\\nAs seen in the third image, the model\'s answers during training improve as it memorizes the training questions with greater fidelity, leading to a continuous decrease in training loss. However, test performance initially improves, then declines as the model overfits to the training set. Finally, as the model groks, **test loss drops to near zero**, indicating successful generalization. These grokked models can be remarkably powerful\u2014 [one team](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.150712) even managed to outperform GPT-4 Turbo and Gemini 1.5 using a grokked GPT[^3].\\n\\nRecently, the [Grokfast team](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.20233) discovered that **memorization and generalization are driven by two distinct learning processes**, a fast and a slow one. Using Fourier transformations, they determined that adjustments to model weights during training can be decomposed into **high-frequency signals** (associated with memorization) and **low-frequency signals** (associated with generalization). By amplifying the low-frequency signals, they vastly accelerated generalization.\\n\\n### ![Memorization and Generalization](./3.png)\\n\\nAt roughly the same time, a [research team in Brazil](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08282) explored what happens when an AI groks. They suspected that the model was **identifying relationships between different clusters of training data**, so they curated a dataset with known clusters. Removing a cluster drastically reduced generalization, while adding just a few examples from that cluster restored it.\\n\\n### ![Accuracy](./4.png)\\n\\n\\nThese findings suggest that when an AI **groks**, it carefully adjusts its weights to encode information about relationships between groups of data while preserving its ability to recall the original training set. This delicate adjustment process explains why grokking takes so long.\\n\\nTo enable this, it is obliged to develop an internal metalanguage that will allow it to conduct internal evaluations of the \\"truthiness\\" of any given input statement based upon its abstraction of similar statements received previously. If every flower in the cat\'s eyes is blue or purple, then an input suggesting that it should place a yellow one there will be flagged up as likely incorrect and checked. The result is that the model, when asked a question, does not simply spit out an average of the closest bits of rote learning it knows, it compares the likely answer against its own abstraction of answers within that category, coming up with a much better output. Or, as [Wang et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.15071) put it:\\n\\n### ![Wang et al.](./Wang-article.png)\\n\\n\\nThis would explain both the **slow weight change** during the grokking process and the **sudden leap in performance** once it generalizes. Further evidence from [Yunis et al](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=6NHnsjsYXH) suggests that grokking is associated with the model discovering a **low-rank encoding solution** (i.e., one that multiplies smaller-than-normal matrices):\\n\\n### ![Grokking, Rank Minimization & Generalization](./5.png)\\nThis, in turn, implies that the model is suddenly achieving higher performance as a consequence of encoding fewer features. The only possible explanation for this is that it has developed its own abstraction layer in which to talk to itself about higher order truths.\\n\\n## Building Upon These Results\\n\\nGrokking has the additional advantage of requiring relatively little data to attempt. Now that our [Generalising Agents](https://xianyangcb.substack.com/p/artificial-intelligences-in-the-guanzi) are up and producing data, our intention is to use this information - which fulfills the high quality/structured data requirements for grokking - to attempt to train a series of models. Transformers - even when grokked - are [known to struggle](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.15071) with composition tasks (i.e. ones relating to facts stored in different parts of the model), likely on account of their structure. Consequently, we plan to use diffusion models. These, despite the higher training cost, display [grokking-like behaviour](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/file/9d0f188c7947eacb0c07f709576824f6-Paper-Conference.pdf) throughout the normal training process, not simply under specific conditions. Moreover, they over-perform on [compsitional tasks](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/file/9d0f188c7947eacb0c07f709576824f6-Paper-Conference.pdf) as well as on [coding tasks more generally](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.17891) [^4], most likely due to their multiplicative approach to learning, as described [here](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/file/9d0f188c7947eacb0c07f709576824f6-Paper-Conference.pdf). This is interesting from our perspective, given that we predicted something similar and made it a foundational component of our [Generalising Agent](https://xianyangcb.substack.com/p/a-system-for-evolving-general-artificial-intelligence-from-existing-technologies-b4f5c4d1335a) schema in 2020.\\n\\n\\n\\n### ![Capabilities & Compositionality](capabilities.png)\\n\\nThis approach, in theory, could produce models capable of **discovering new real-world knowledge** and **generalizing relationships between data points**.

Such an AI would be capable of independent learning without results-verification, adapt to its environment, learn new skills without losing old ones, and be able to reason by analogy. It would grow better at learning new skills with each additional skill acquired, opening a pathway for exponential improvement.\\n\\n## The Problem\\n\\nThe development of general artificial intelligence is hampered by engineers\' inability to create a system capable of assessing its own performance, and thereby of improving itself. A machine capable of these two tasks would grow more intelligent at an exponential rate \u2014 the \\"intelligence explosion\\" that is often described as a precursor to a technological singularity.\\n\\nThe impossibility of self-referential improvement is not a reflection of present limits on technology, but of the fundamental laws of mathematics. As Alfred Tarski proved in the 1930s, it is \\"impossible to construct a correct definition of truth if only such categories are used which appear in the language under consideration.\\" In other words, it is impossible to accurately assess a system from within that system. To evaluate its own performance, a program would need to be more advanced than itself \u2014 an obvious paradox.\\n\\nThis raises an important question: if systems capable of self-improvement are apparently impossible to build, why are they so prevalent? You are reading this using two of them \u2013 the internet and your brain \u2013 and other examples abound in nature. The answer is that these systems are not purely self-referential. In every case they rely upon some external and incontrovertible measure by which they can objectively evaluate and improve their performance.\\n\\nIn this paper we argue that while it is indeed impossible to construct an accurate self-referential evaluation system in an electronic context, it is possible to establish a universal and objective measure of performance that would render such self-referential improvement unnecessary. This would open the way for the development of increasingly general forms of artificial intelligence.\\n\\n## Evaluating Intelligence\\n\\nIn academic and scientific settings intelligence tends to be judged based upon a correctness heuristic: intelligence is the ability to solve problems correctly. From an evolutionary perspective, however, intelligence exists for no other reason than to improve a creature\'s survival prospects. Since it is capacity for evolution rather than the ability to solve any particular problem that interests us in this case, it is thus this survival heuristic that must be the starting point for any attempt to measure intelligence.\\n\\n### ![Generalist AI Components ](./img1.png)\\n\\nFor biological life, survival is predicated upon the acquisition of goods required to facilitate it: food, water, shelter, allies etc., which can be considered as proxies for survivability. For a computer program, survival is predicated upon redundancy: the more copies there are of a given quantum of data, the longer the half-life of the data. Data that is stored in two locations is more likely to still exist in six months\' time than data that is stored in only one location \u2014 hence the importance of backing up one\'s files. Under such conditions, a bigger program is necessarily a smarter one.\\n\\nWe thus argue that if one gives a reinforcement learning system the goal of occupying ever more non-volatile memory space, its size becomes a measure of its intelligence. Every time it reaches the limit of its current disk space it is forced to learn a new skill in order to annex more, thus the number of memory blocks occupied functions as an objective universal measure of intelligence.\\n\\nWhile systems already exist that use rewards to drive machine learning, they are based on the principle of rewarding the system for getting better at a given task \u2013 the correctness heuristic covered above. Under our design, disk space functions as a universal reward. No matter the specifics of the problem at hand, a solution that results in more space being gained is always correct, while one that does not is always wrong. The result is that no human or human-crafted assessment mechanism is necessary to evaluate and compensate the system\'s work.\\n\\n## Evolving Intelligence\\n\\nWe therefore suggest that an increasingly generalist AI could be pushed to evolve from three basic components.\\n\\n1. **Code generation model.** A fine-tuneable code generation model\u2014ideally a diffusion model for reasons described below\u2014which will receive the initial instruction to write scripts aimed at taking over additional disk space.  \\n2. **Testing module.** A testing module, which will try out the code that is thus generated. If any script succeeds in annexing additional space, this space will be used to store the details of the successful code, which will then be used in future training rounds to further fine-tune the code generation model and thus improve its chances of successfully solving future problems.  \\n   - If more space than needed is acquired, the extra space should be filled with duplicate records, following the survivability-of-data principle.  \\n3. **Training database.** The annexed space serves as training data for subsequent iterations, so each new skill makes the next one easier\u2014producing an \\"intelligence explosion.\\"\\n\\nIn the original version of this paper, in which we planned to use a system of genetic algorithms to recombine blocks of known code, we posited a learning process that we represented graphically as follows:\\n\\n### ![Learning Process Grids](./img2.png)\\n\\n> \\"Imagine an 8\xd78 grid of white squares. Periodically one of the squares is selected at random and coloured black, to represent a skill that the system aims to acquire. In the first round, the chances of the square selected being next to another black square\u2014representing a skill that the system already possesses\u2014are zero. In the second round, when one square/skill has already been acquired, the chances of the next black square being in close proximity to an existing black square have fallen to 8/63. By the third round the probability is 16/62, and by the fourth you have a better than one in three chance of landing next to an existing black square.\\n\\n> During any given iteration of the process the program will only learn a single skill, but the system as a whole is structured such that the acquisition of each new skill facilitates the acquisition of future skills: the \\"intelligence explosion\\" described in the introduction.\\"\\n\\nInterestingly, the existence of such a process was confirmed in 2023, via [paper](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/file/9d0f188c7947eacb0c07f709576824f6-Paper-Conference.pdf) outlining the multiplicative learning abilities of diffusion models.\\n\\n### ![Multiplicative Learning Abilities](./img3.png)\\n\\nIt is for this reason that we privilege the use of diffusion models over transformers in this case, as explained in greater detail [here](https://xianyangcb.substack.com/p/defining-t-schemas-via-the-parametric).\\n\\n## A Concrete Example\\n\\nSupposing a new program, composed of the parts described above, is seeded to a given environment. The first thing it is likely to encounter is a block of empty disk space: the code generation model will then write a script to attempt to occupy this space, which is passed to the testing module. This process is repeated until one of the scripts written is successful. Success having been achieved, the space acquired then becomes part of the program\'s training database, being used to store the details of the code used to acquire it for future fine-tuning cycles.\\n\\n### ![New AI Training](./img4.png)\\n\\nThe AI will continue occupying empty space until it runs into a block of non-empty space\u2014say, one that is occupied by a file. The code generation process is repeated using the freshly fine-tuned code generation model until a solution for this problem is found. This solution will be stored in the newly expanded database and used in future training.\\n\\n### ![Fine-tuned Code Generation Model ](./img5.png)\\n\\n> It should be noted that while simply having the AI move from block to block is a feasible approach, it is also somewhat inefficient\u2014in the real system a Q-learning algorithm will be used to optimise for likely rewards based upon experience.\\n\\n## The Development Environment\\n\\nThe AI itself is only half of the solution, however. The environment in which it evolves is just as important, since it is this environment that will determine the direction of its evolution. In order to ensure continuous improvement in the skills and knowledge of the AI, it should be presented with finely graded challenges to overcome, allowing it to find easier problems to solve in its initial stages and move onto increasingly difficult ones as its skills expand. Eventually, it should also be possible to direct the AI\'s evolution by presenting it with an environment that forces it to solve problems deliberately contrived to teach it particular skills.\\n\\nHowever, to get to this stage other technical stumbling blocks also need to be dealt with, first and foremost, the question of how to prevent such a system from overwriting itself or crashing the device upon which it is running. There are various possible solutions to this issue. The most obvious one is simply to allow only the annexation of additional space on devices reached via a network connection and not on the local device. This would be helpful not just in preventing the problems described above, but also insofar as that it would open up the way for the constitution of a \\"counter-indications database\\"\u2014a record of code that, when tried, crashed a connected device, and which should therefore be avoided in future. This would, presumably, significantly improve the overall learning process. However, it also raises another issue: that of safety. A system such as we describe, though it may be corralled into performing useful tasks, remains essentially predatory\u2014a form of self-directed malware. Steps should thus be taken to physically isolate the development environment from other networks.\\n\\n## The Prompting Process\\n\\nWhen we wrote the first draft of this design it at no point occurred to us that when sophisticated code generation models became widely available they would be prompted primarily using natural language, and certain modifications had to be made to account for this. In the present version of the design, we propose the use of a standard prompt format:"}]}}')}}]);
